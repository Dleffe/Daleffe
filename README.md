Hi! My name is Augusto Daleffe, I'm a computer engineer student at Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC). This is my digital workspace, where I share projects and code related to my academic and professional journey in the field of computing. 

I'm constantly looking for challenges that allow me to apply my knowledge and creativity. I believe that programming goes beyond simple code. it's a way of expressing ideas and solving problems in an innovative way. That's why you'll see all kinds of code in this workspace.
